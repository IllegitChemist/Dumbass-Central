  <h1><center><a href="index.html" class="no-underline">Hack Central</a></center></h1>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
<p>1. Click the link below.
2. On the left side, click "Settings".
3. Where it says "Amount of iframes", move the slider to the left until the number on the right of the slider says "1000".
4. On the left side, click "The Exploit".
5. On the tile that says GoGuardian, click the pill-shaped button that says "Disable".
6. Follow the instructions EXACTLY.
Notes:
If your computer freezes for more that 2 minutes:
1. You used over 1000 iframes.
2. You fucked up somewhere else in the process.
</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT USE IN CLASS</strong></p>
<p>The school has enforced a policy where if you are on your computer during class, but not visible on GoGuardian, they will <strong>search your computer.</strong></p>
<p>This is an easy way to reveal this exploit's existence to the school and <strong>get it patched.
ONLY USE THIS AT HOME.</strong></p>
<p>On that happy note, click <a target="_blank" href="/index.html">here</a> for the exploit page.
It will open in a new tab, but i recommending closing all tabs other than exploit-related shit, <b>happy xploiting!</b></p>
